# Java Virtual Machine written in Zig
Just like my other project [the Rust JVM](https://github.com/AleksanderEvensen/Rusty-JVM), I'm making a JVM in Zig to learn the language.

I will also utilize this opportunity to improve on my old design.
I'll admit that the Rust version wasn't very "Rusty" and could've been solved in a much better way.
